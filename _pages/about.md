My name is Taylor Davis, and I am attending Virginia Tech to get my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Cybersecurity. At Virginia Tech, I am an Undergraduate Lab Assistant at the FRITH Engineering Lab and a Premium Hospitality Assistant for our Hokies basketball, baseball, and football games. Some of my club and team activities include my work on the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team and my participation in the Filipino American Student Association. If you would like to know more about me, my email and LinkedIn are both attached.
